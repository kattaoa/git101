# GIT

# Get remote repo (after forking) to local hard drive:

1. Go to remote repo on GitHub
2. Copy link in dropdown from "Clone or download" → <url>
3. Open Terminal
4. Use `cd` to navigate to desired working directory
5. Run `git clone` <url>


# Updating remote repo from local repo:

## Add file

1. Create changes to local repo
	- add new file called blank.txt to local repo
2. Navigate to local repo
3. View untracked files and more with `git status`
4. Run `git add blank.txt`
5. Double check with `git status`
6. Commit with `git commit -m "first commit"`
7. Ensure the remote repo is correctly linked via `git remote -v` → origin
8. Run `git push -u origin master` to push local repo into master branch of origin remote repo

## Remove file

1. git rm blank.txt
2. git status
3. git commit -m "delete"
4. git push -u origin master

# Working with branches:

## Create a new branch

I added some preliminary files, used `git add` and `git commit`. Now let us create a new branch called "addfiles" with these commits.

1. Create a new branch called addfiles: git checkout -b addfiles
2. Check to make sure we have switched to the new branch: git branch


## Push branch to GitHub 

1. git push origin addfiles
2. Manage pull requests, etc. in GitHub

 
# Get changes from computer back to GitHub:

1. Go to master branch: git checkout master
2. Update local repo: git pull origin master
